        <p class="sections"> In the world of Smylos a person’s wealth defines
          its social status. Where usually wealth is defined by money, in Smylos
          it is defined by a smile. The bigger the smile, the wealthier you are.
          You cannot decide if you want to smile, it is just a measurement of your
          wealth. This project was developed as a group work during the Complex
          Artifacts and System Design Studio course.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">

          <p class="treinta"> The player has to move his phone on the board to unlock and access
            the narrative contents available on the game app. The story is
            conveyed through two different media: written conversations and audios.
            <br>
            <br>The written ones happen between the characters and the player,
            who has the possibility to interact and sometimes choose his own
            answer. They are presented as a common mobile chat. The player can
            also choose where to go and who to talk to, by moving the phone on
            the map.
            <br>
            <br>The audios contain other conversations between the characters
            that the player can listen to but not answer. For further interaction,
            he is given the opportunity to eavesdrop on other characters talking
            privately with each other.
            <br><br>The game is meant to be sound-based as the characters are
            not visually defined, but rather depicted through their tone of voice
            and environment sounds.

            we take advantage of spaces that usually consist of a lot of waiting.
            With the technology implemented in the app, the player can play the
            game in one place and continue in another, making the experience
            even more fluid and immersive.

            a king dressed as a homeless person in a theatre play. Crates decides

            information and context, from the day they were born until the day
            they died. Through this method, we ensured we provided them with
            depth and detail. At last, the group created a relational map to
            link them with each other. Once their stories were intertwined,
            we assigned each character a specific role in the game plot.</p>

            On the ground floor of the tower, we encounter ourselves the city
            office, where every inhabitant needs to declare monthly his wealth
            in order to distribute the sizes of the smiles.
            <br><br>Going further from the centre to the edge of the city, people
            are progressively less wealthy. Outside the city, the slums spread

            smile at all.
            <br><br>Between the city and the slum, there is a little shop where

            represents how the conversations are unlocked at each level. Level
            4 is a representation of the interaction between audio and responses
